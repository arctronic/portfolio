        <h2>Biggan Bortika</h2>
        <h3 id="name">2017 - Present | Bangla Science Blog</h3>
        <p>
          It was our initiative from class 10. Basically, we thought what if we
          can gather all the science related information together! The site is
          in bangla lanuage, so that we can understand easily. It has more than
          600+ contents and 20 volunteer writers.

        <h2>C++ and SFML Project</h2>
        <h3 id="name">2020 | AlgoSketch - Algorithm Visualizer</h3>
        <p>
          It's a project based on C++ OOP concept. Basically you can have a lot
          of fun with it. There's sorting Algorithm and Graph algorithm
          visualizer. Fun to learn what beneath an algorithm. Me and my
          friend(also enrolled in this course), had made it together.

        <h2>C and Linux Terminal</h2>
        <h3 id="name">2020 | Cedit - Terminal Based Text Editor</h3>
        <p>
          This project purpose was to learn the C concept for linux. We've
          learnt about operating system and how to inherit the utility of the
          OS. Fun fact is, this project accidently created 7.8GB text file,
          because I've not freed the pointer. And after sme time my Ubuntu fully
          crashed.
